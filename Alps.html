      <h2>The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland.</h2>

      <h2>The Alps are the youngest and most densely populated mountain range in Europe. They were formed about 65 million years ago.</h2>
      <img src="images/alps3.jpg" alt="alps1">
      <h2>The mountains were formed as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided.</h2>
      <img src="images/alps4.jpg" alt="alps1">
      <h2>The Alps are generally divided into Western Alps and Eastern Alps, cut along a line between Lake Constance and Lake Como, following the Rhine valley.</h2>
      <img src="images/alps5.jpg" alt="alps1">
      <h2>The Western Alps are higher, but their central chain is shorter and much curved; they are located in France, Italy and Switzerland.</h2>
      <img src="images/alps6.jpg" alt="alps1">
      <h2>The Eastern Alps (main ridge elongated and broad) belong to Austria, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland.</h2>

      <h2>Mont Blanc, at 4,809 meters (15,777 feet), is the highest peak in the Alps.</h2>

      <h2>Other tall peaks in the Alps include the Dufourspitze, Weisshorn, Finsteraarhorn, and the famous Matterhorn</h2>

      <h2>The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 meters (13,123 ft), known as the “four-thousanders“.</h2>
